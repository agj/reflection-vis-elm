# Visualizing reflection

An small Elm app that visualizes a “hall of mirrors” effect, mapping the line of sight both as it bounces between the mirrors and as it is intuitively projected into the space “inside” the mirror.

## Running locally

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) ~v19 and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) ~v8, as well as a Posix shell to run the commands.
npm should also work instead of pnpm, but it is untested.

Run the following commands to install dependencies and start a server to view in your browser:

```sh
pnpm install
make start
```
